== Custom Header + Featured Images ==

Ecto includes a unique treatment for the custom header and featured images to let you customize specific posts and pages. A few things to note:

* If a custom header is activated, it will appear on every post and page. If a featured image is set for a post or page, it will be displayed instead of the custom header.
